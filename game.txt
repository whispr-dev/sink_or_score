new game: follow either the path of good or evil.
if evil invent tortures for first purgatory then hell,
if good then invent first earthly  pleasure then heavenly ecstasy

- e.g. heavenly ecstasy example - a drug that gives the feeling of immense relief - and yet is non-addictive!
- e.g. gambling, but you don't have any screen or sound - just every so--often it pays out and barely enough to keep you come back for more



existing things for sense of humour:
tortures::
- 2 factor
- passwords with capitol and a lc and a number and a symbol and must be 8 minimum and and and
- power cables that are exactly 1 inch too short, always, everywhere, for everyone
- every goddamn tie you open a bottle of water and they fill it so full that you cover yourself cos it squirts everywhere
- go to fill coffee always drips down goddamn side no matter how absolutely fucking perfectly your pour leaving a brown sticky rivulet
- you pick up a plastic grossery bag full of shopping and one handle just fucking melts like its 2000degrees and the bag fucking collapses and you no long can use it as a bag.


existing things for some sense of humour:
ecstasies::
- meth
- cold beer on a hot day
- pussy
- naps
- nicotine after sex, food, sleep


so, mechanic of game:
awaken - everything seems just another day but as you observe thins around you it begins to dawn upon you that there's no fucking way all this shit is coincidental r accidental - it absolutely must be by design to torture and [pleasure to the absolute highest degree possible in yet such a way as to cause no harm or real visible damage or anyth9ing significant other than total annoyance or brief mild un that always wears off. frankly it suddenly twigs - you must've in goddamn purgatory its the only explanation for a setup so utterly perfectly so.

so - you gonna' have to make a decision here you realise - are you gonna' aim for heaven and start trying to make yours and others lives as pleasant and heavenly as possible? or, are you going got join the dark force and invent the evilest, twisted, cruel, tortures you can devise and try to cling the ranks of the devils motley crew.

the choice is yours and the inventions yours to make when you try to go ads far as possible up the ranks of angels or down the loader of hecc in sink or score?


-------

there shall be an initial level of purgatory where you commit to your chosen path - good or evil.
here you have to score enough points making totally benign but utterly ideal in there either subtle but unfulfilling pleasure or utterly annoying yet totally unavoidably minor annoyance tortures to be admitted into the very lowest ranks of your chosen spiritual beings.

so, will you as you sit there realising that the reason your damned fingerprint scanner never works and the face recognition doesn't recognise is because guess what, surprise, surprise  -yes you are in fact already dead - this is the tough it now - which path will you follow?

-------

then we progress to the meat of the game - climbing levels by making at least one significantly truly outstanding g contribution heaven or hell relevant to your current difficulty level, and then successfully demonstrating it to your superiors in order to attain upward or downward movement on THE LADDER.

-------

THE LADDER is going up a escalator with the pearly gates at the top, shining and bright and inviting and everything that can be desired. with an ahhhhhhhhhh. going own it is  waterslide with no water and occasional places where t simply peters out into a fucking rough rubber mat [each level divide.]

-------

the game runs on a points system which are earned via either inventing things or suffering their effcts. eceriences ar much less poits than inventions so requiring god inventions to a actively progress up/down THE LADDER.

-------

gam has a meta toit - character development along the lines of RPGs in that you have initial points to spend and gain new points each tine you ascend or descend a level. these when spent to their most efficient manner will allow for a significantly more 0speedy progress compared to spending them poorly and likewise they add much flavor when seeing the development and growth along the 'tech trees' called inspiration rivulets. by sending your allotted droplets of inspiration sweat wisely you develop better ideas and get hints and tips and help along the way significantly boosting your progress and providing externa entry points for more humorous shit we invented ourselves.



tortures
- things that say look here but there's 10 other menus and not the one they say look in
- Microsoft windows - navigation
- Linux ux
- putting the fucking delete and backspace within fingers accident of enter - omfg [true hecc torture stuck in purgatory - yikes!]

- CAPSLOCK
- sticky keys
- the bit of biometrics fingerprint where it says now do the edges and you've already gone halfway over the nail - it's legit built into the fucking detector to wait 'til after you already did the edges. fucking fact.
- when the only water to drink is the tail end of a bottle and it's really warm and plasticy and there's never quite enough for swallowing pills or rinsing mouth or w/e
- microwave always manages to make part nuclear and part still cold even though it turns and you do the half time swappy round instruction etc.
- those li'l ice-cube bits in fridges that ain't big enough to make more than about a drink ';n a half's worth of ice they manage to constantly drip and soak every fucking thing in the fridge wit slow water torture moistness.
- fucking ATMs taking like 20mins to deliver cash via way too many unnecessary button presses - sure all it needs is PIN, amount -\ spew money. yet somehow they manage 320 button reses and each has a 1min wait in-between the next screen loading. like c'mon already I just wan my fucking money. give!
- benzos
- stop lights always being just the wrong point I  the fucking cycle no matter how fats you drive, or slow and I you go perfect -the fucking traffic screws anyways - you can't win.
- sharing size bags of chips -tat tend to be a smidge too big to finish in sitting yet you just can in anyway seal 'em and what's the damn point - who wants 7 chips the next day? so you fins 'em an then are way too full. spoiling those chips for a good while.
- proprietary connectors like for psus or headphrones or w/e that cost like $120 for something that only should cost $3.
- those little shitty fucking screws that hold glasses together. you know 'em. I need say no more. I swear they can both teleport and disappear invisibly upon touching ground from even 1mm and on soft touch.
