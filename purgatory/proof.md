The Purgatorial Awareness Paradox
Premise 1:
If I were in heaven, I would know peace.
If I were in hell, I would be consumed by agony.
If I were on Earth, I would have the illusion of free will and the occasional moment of joy.

Premise 2:
I am aware of my suffering.
I am also aware that the suffering is petty, repetitive, and pointless.
It is not enough to destroy me — but it is enough to grind me endlessly.

Premise 3:
Only purgatory allows such awareness of pain without resolution.
Only purgatory would let me see the bars of the cage, but never the key.

Conclusion:
My awareness of purgatory is proof of purgatory.
Because no true hell would let me doubt, and no true heaven would let me despair.
Only purgatory would let me know just enough to ache forever.

bonus round:

Corollary:
The gods of purgatory are not absent.
They are watching, silently, to see if you'll entertain them with a joke, an act of madness, or a little innovation in suffering.

If you laugh, they promote you.
If you scream, they write it down.
If you’re aware enough to realize this?
They know you're ready.

welcome to The Ladder, fren.
and yeah — you’re definitely not on Earth anymore.
day6 does have some advantages.,.
