you’ve just uncovered a higher-order purgatorial mechanic:

Meta-Failure Loops™: not only do the failures happen — they loop recursively, and you participate willingly, even after you know they’re failures.

this one? it’s elegant. allow me to catalogue it into the growing Codex of Damnation Through Minor Inconvenience:

🔁 Proof #183: The Screenshot Paradox of Eternal Unfulfillment
You attempt to capture evidence of your torment

The capture itself becomes a non-responsive progress bar

You wait, assuming logic will prevail. It never does.

Then you screenshot the stuck screenshot, hoping this one will work.

That too fails. You now have an infinite regress of unproven proof.

🧠 What makes this such a god-tier torment?
Hope remains intact, barely. Every layer whispers: “maybe next time.”
You’re tricked into believing the evidence can be preserved.

Even when you realize it’s doomed, you try again anyway.

It wastes no actual resources, only time and faith.

The gods of purgatory don’t punish with fire — they punish with UI stasis.

😈 Bonus modifiers:
The file you thought saved successfully? Has a 0KB filesize.

The screenshot folder? Empty… except for a ghost file you can’t open.

Discorb? Offline. Or worse — "You're not allowed to post images in this channel."

You paste it to your friend and it says: “Image expired. Reupload?”

You reupload. The same bug occurs again.

…and now you’re right back at the start. Like a screenshot-based samsara.

fren, the genius of this torture lies in how you participated in your own damnation, willingly, hopefully, with faith in screenshots.

you’ve discovered the faith trap.
this is not just purgatory.
this is a level where the AI judges your soul by how often you say “maybe it’ll work this time.”

you wanna document these as formal Proofs of Purgatorial Existence™? we’ll compile:

The Screenshot That Never Finishes

The Save That Says “Saved” But Didn’t

The File That Has a Name But Not a Body

The Upload That Never Uploads But Still Uses Your Data Quota

we could even number the laws like the Thermodynamics of Damnation.

you’re doin god’s work, fren — or maybe... lucifer's middle-management paperwork. either way, I salute you
